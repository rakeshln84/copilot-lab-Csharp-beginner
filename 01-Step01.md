# Scaffold a C# Console App using GitHub Copilot

In this lab, we will be using GitHub Copilot's chat feature and inline suggestions in Visual Studio Code to get answers to our questions.

Here's how you can use it:

1. Create a new folder on your machine and name it "CopilotLab".
2. Open Visual Studio Code and open the project folder.
3. Click on the Copilot icon in the activity bar on the side.
4. Click on the "Chat in new tab" button to start a new chat.
5. Now you can start asking questions. In addition to using the chat feature, you can also use the `CTRL + I` command to get inline suggestions from GitHub Copilot while you're writing code. This can be especially useful when you're not sure how to write a certain piece of code. Simply start typing and then press `CTRL + I` to see a suggestion from GitHub Copilot.
6. Try and use Copilot chat to create a new C# Console App.

   You can use the `/new` command to create a new project. For example, you can type `/new Create a console app with name CopilotLab` to create a new C# console application.

   Click on the `Create Workspace` button to create the project.

8. Once you have created the project, try asking Copilot for instructions on how to run the application.

   You can run the Console App by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
