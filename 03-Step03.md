# Step 3: Refactor and Enhance Code Quality

In this step, we will refactor the code to address some issues and improve its quality. We will leverage GitHub Copilot to assist with the refactoring process.

1. **Make Search Methods Case-Insensitive**

   The search methods implemented in the previous exercise are case-sensitive. Let's refactor these methods to ignore case when comparing strings.

   Use GitHub Copilot to refactor the `SearchAlbumsByArtist`, `SearchAlbumsByTitle`, and `SearchAlbumsByGenre` methods to perform case-insensitive comparisons.

2. **Refactor `AddAlbum` Method**

   Refactor the `AddAlbum` method to check if an album already exists before adding it to the list. If an album with the same `Title` already exists, throw an exception with the message "Album already exists".

   The refactored `AddAlbum` method should look like this:

   ```csharp
   public void AddAlbum(Album album)
   {
       if (_albums.Any(a => a.Title.Equals(album.Title, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)))
       {
           throw new Exception("Album already exists");
       }
       _albums.Add(album);
   }
   ```

3. **Introduce Custom Exception**

   Create a custom exception class `AlbumAlreadyExistsException`. Refactor the `AddAlbum` method to throw this custom exception when an album already exists.

4. **Update Application for User Interaction**

   Update the application to provide users with options to search albums by artist, title, or genre. Based on the user's choice, the application should display the list of matching albums.

   Update the `Main` method in the `Program.cs` file to include the following options:

   - Search albums by artist
   - Search albums by title
   - Search albums by genre

   Use the `PrintAlbums` method below to print the search results in a tabular format:

   ```csharp
   public static void PrintAlbums(List<Album> albums)
   {
       Console.WriteLine("--------------------------------------------------------------");
       Console.WriteLine("|   ID   |        Title        |       Artist       |   Genre   |");
       Console.WriteLine("--------------------------------------------------------------");
       foreach (var album in albums)
       {
           Console.WriteLine($"| {album.Id,-6} | {album.Title,-19} | {album.Artist,-18} | {album.Genre,-9} |");
       }
       Console.WriteLine("--------------------------------------------------------------");
   }
   ```

   The updated `Main` method should look like this:

   ```csharp
   public static void Main(string[] args)
   {
       var musicStoreService = new MusicStoreService();
       var albums = musicStoreService.GetAlbums();

       Console.WriteLine("Choose an option:");
       Console.WriteLine("1. Search albums by artist");
       Console.WriteLine("2. Search albums by title");
       Console.WriteLine("3. Search albums by genre");

       var option = Console.ReadLine();

       switch (option)
       {
           case "1":
               Console.WriteLine("Enter artist name:");
               var artist = Console.ReadLine();
               var albumsByArtist = musicStoreService.SearchAlbumsByArtist(artist);
               PrintAlbums(albumsByArtist);
               break;
           case "2":
               Console.WriteLine("Enter title:");
               var title = Console.ReadLine();
               var albumsByTitle = musicStoreService.SearchAlbumsByTitle(title);
               PrintAlbums(albumsByTitle);
               break;
           case "3":
               Console.WriteLine("Enter genre:");
               var genre = Console.ReadLine();
               var albumsByGenre = musicStoreService.SearchAlbumsByGenre(genre);
               PrintAlbums(albumsByGenre);
               break;
           default:
               Console.WriteLine("Invalid option");
               break;
       }
   }
   ```

   If you have used the `Main` method from the sample code, you can use GitHub Copilot's `Explain` feature to understand into the logic behind the code.

5. **Test the Application**

   Run the application and test the search functionality by artist, title, and genre. You should see the matching albums displayed based on the search criteria entered by the user in the console.

## Additional Challenges

- Add required validation to the `AddAlbum` method to ensure that the `Title`, and `Artist` properties are not empty.
- Update the search methods to allow partial matches.
- Sort the albums by release date before displaying them.
- Add logging to log any exceptions that occur during the search process.
